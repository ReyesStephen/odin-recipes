    <p><h2>Description</h2></p>

<p>A quick and simple grilled pork chop that everyone will love featuring a simple and easy glaze.</p>

<p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>

    <ul>
       <li>paprika</li>
       <li>salt</li> 
       <li>pepper</li>
       <li>onion powder</li>
       <li>garlic</li>
       <li>pork loin</li>
    </ul>

<p><h2>Steps</h2></p>

    <ol>
        <li>Combine smoked paprika, salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic, and cayenne in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Pat chops dry with a paper towel and evenly distribute dry ingredient mixture on front and back of each chop. With fingertips, lightly rub dry ingredient mixture into the chops on both sides.</li>
        <li>Place chops on a plate and cover with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 8 hours.</li>
        <li>Remove rubbed chops from the refrigerator and allow to come to room temperature, about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>While chops are getting to room temperature, clean the grate of an outdoor gas grill and preheat to medium heat.</li>
        <li>When the grill is ready, lightly spray chops with avocado oil spray.</li>
        <li>Lightly oil the grill grates, place chops on the grill, and cook for about 3 minutes. Rotate chops 90 degrees to create a criss-cross grill pattern and continue grilling for 3 minutes. Turn chops and grill until pork chops are no longer pink inside, about 4 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Remove to a serving platter and allow to rest under a foil tent, for about 5 minutes. Serve warm.</li>
    </ol>
